## 用户评论摘录

- **Wissam**  
  > Best Software of its kind. I have been using Gunbot for almost a year now; its performance is remarkable and automation makes it a real money maker with added peace of mind. The team is very supportive and the documentation is excellent. Still more valuable features can be added that I am looking forward to see.

- **Didier**  
  > Bought Gunbot in November, fumbled with Sim in December... Kicked off real trading last month... And after 1 month I made back the ultimate lifetime licence cost 2 times. Thanks for your great software @GuntharDeNiro and to all those who helped make it stronger with new strategies and feedback for improving the systems over the years. This is the best bot I have seen in terms of control we have as a user.

- **Ed**  
  > I did a substantial amount of research before purchasing automated trading software and I can confidently say I have zero regrets going with Gunbot. I come from a manual trading background, and the support network here is absolutely insane in terms of helpfulness—the response time is faster than what you would get from your wife! This product deserves a 5 star review ALL DAY LONG.

- **Nikita**  
  > Would definitely give Gunbot 5 stars. Because even for someone like me, who is a complete beginner to the world of trading bots, and will obviously struggle with the typical 'newbie' error codes associated with setting up a new software that you are not familiar with. Their fast responding support team and wiki were more than enough to solve these issues.

- **Robert**  
  > Look, use stepgridscalp leave default and make money. [...] This community is fantastic and I will testify it is not a scam. Been a part of it since 2017. Making big fucking money with it.

- **Mike**  
  > Trailing stops are great and all but let’s be honest, on markets that run 24/7 more is required. Much more. GunBot was something I wished for a long time and my only regret is not doing it sooner. The bot itself has been awesome so far, and the support has been even better. Very fast responses, super knowledgeable, and friendly.

- **Lebowski**  
  > Major love to the GB team. I started trading on DYDX using SGSFutures on Feb 26th. Started with $496 USD and I'm currently at $1,358 USD today in portfolio value. Running on 20 pairs. :)

- **Mike (二)**  
  > It’s extremely intimidating to allow a bot to control large sums of your money. Support had me go live in two days from payment to first trade. I’m sitting here writing this, watching my daughter play, bot streaming in background, and I finally feel like I can look away from my screen for more than 10 minutes.

- **EMC**  
  > Outstanding Trading Bot with Robust Features and Reliability! Gunbot has consistently exceeded my expectations.

- **Jan**  
  > Running so good out of the box I haven’t really looked into all switches and details.

- **Stefan**  
  > Its making money out of the box just after editing balance settings, I have a plan to use it for scalping using TA, turning it on or off depending on the market, but so far it is great.

- **Daniel**  
  > StepGridHedge worked like a charm in this up/down market, so far best from out of the box strategy, fire and forget and drink mojitos :)

- **Nenad**  
  > StepGrid has become default to beat (and pretty hard).

- **Dave**  
  > After being quite suspicious I have quite good results with the spotgrid. Did not understand it properly in the first place - but now got the hang of it and it works quite well.

- **B B**  
  > It's a great product. I spent about a year working on my own bot in Python before discovering Gunbot. It turned out to be exactly what I envisioned for my 'dream bot,' but far more advanced and mature. That's why I consider it an excellent product that is worth every dollar. Thank you very much, and Merry Christmas!

- **ingo**  
  > BTW, your support is mind-blowing, but watching your baby bot grow for a few years now is a whole other game. You guys are absolutely the best!

- **isayyas**  
  > Having purchased Gunbot back in 2017, and using it on and off throughout the years, I am always impressed by the improvements made here internally and through the community. I rarely have to ask questions because I can find what I need on the wiki or through the telegram channel. You guys are amazing and thank you.

- **puffncough**  
  > The strats in the last year have been just crazy. The competition and especially the top 5 each time are just completely insane. The last year for Gunbot was unbelievable. If we had what we have right now, with no changes or updates, we would be already golden. Those strats just keep getting better and more refined. I never felt more confident in recommending Gunbot to a friend than now.

- **Schurli**  
  > I’ve been using Gunbot for quite some time, and it has been a solid trading tool for me. The interface is easy enough to pick up, but it’s definitely not for complete beginners with no trading experience. You still need to think things through and apply your own knowledge to get the best results from its many features. In terms of performance, it has been consistent, and I’ve rarely run into issues. When I did have questions, the support team responded quickly and helped me out. If you know your way around trading and want a bot that offers flexibility, Gunbot is a good choice.

- **Walton**  
  > Great peace of Software. Always evolving. New features added all the time without additional cost. Amazing community helping each other out with trading and other stuff.

- **Siggen**  
  > My friend and I have been comparing Eazybot vs Gunbot. Gunbot is definitely better and more flexible in the long run. In addition, so far it is winning the comparisons we've been doing.

- **Eden**  
  > I look around and see so many talented people working on their own great strategies. It's very heartening to be with people who want the same.

- **Jon**  
  > I am very thankful for everyone here—a fun little community! The difference since 5 years ago would be difficult to even explain to new users. There are some extremely talented/ingenious people here.

- **Murtis**  
  > I knew manual trading pretty well but GB was the catalyst to learn how to codify that.

- **Dave (二)**  
  > I remember the time I came to Gunbot from Haasonline; I have made maybe the rightest choice in my life.
